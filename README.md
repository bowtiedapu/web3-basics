# web3-basics

## About

This project aims to demonstrate examples of web3 basics from beginner to advanced as suggested by anonymous members of the BowTied community. This is a work in progress for me, so if you have any suggestions please suggest them or open up a PR.

## How To: Build

1. Clone this project. While this project tries to demonstrate basics, learning by trying to "figure it out" on your own is imperative. If you don't know how to clone a GitHub project, ask your favorite search engine how to do so. If you're really stuck, start a discussion in this repo!
2. Once checked out, run `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Exercise List

1. Connect to an RPC (HTTPS and websocket)
2. Get the current block height
3. Get an account balance for an address
4. Get a transaction by hash
5. Get transactions included in a block
6. Get the current network base fee
7. Convert between different units (i.e. wei to eth)
8. Create a public address from a private key
